EXCLUSIONS\n\nThe obligations in Section 3 do not apply to information that:\n(a) is or becomes publicly known through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;\n(b) was rightfully known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure without restriction;\n(c) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction;\n(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information; or\n(e) is required to be disclosed by applicable law or court order, provided the Receiving Party gives prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party and cooperates with efforts to seek a protective order.\n\n5.
